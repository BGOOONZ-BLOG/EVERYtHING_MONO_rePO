        Creating software isn’t that easy. There is a ton of things to consider. The
        more you actually create, the more you’ll learn.


        And since there are many developers out there who share their experience,
        it’s a hard game to follow all of them. Because of this, we collected the
        following blogs and present you a list of 11 web development blogs worth
        reading.
