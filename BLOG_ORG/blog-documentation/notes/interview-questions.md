### Input

The first line of input contains an integer *N*, representing the number of dolls initially.\
The second line consists of *N* space-separated integers representing the size of dolls.

###

### Constraints

1 ≤ *N* ≤ 105\
1 ≤ *size of doll* ≤ 105

###

### Output

Print an integer representing the minimum number of dolls Oleg has after placing all smaller dolls inside the larger dolls.

### Example #1

Input

4
2 2 3 3

Output

2

Explanation: In order to be left with the minimum number of dolls, Oleg will do the following:

-   Puts doll at index 1 inside doll at index 3 i.e doll of size two in size three.
-   Puts doll at index 2 inside box at index 4 i.e doll of size two in size three

Now he is left with two dolls of size three which cannot be further placed inside each other. So, the output is 2.
