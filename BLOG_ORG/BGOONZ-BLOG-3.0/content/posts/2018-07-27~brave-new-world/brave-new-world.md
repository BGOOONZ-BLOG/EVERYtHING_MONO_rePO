Welcome to my _new_ custom-built blog! Gone is my former WordPress site [janosh-riebesell.com](https://janosh-riebesell.com). This site is JavaScript from head to heel. It's powered mainly by [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and [`styled-components`](https://styled-components.com).

In case you're considering switching your own site to Gatsby or more generally the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org), I definitely recommend it. It was a very enjoyable learning experience. Gatsby is open-source, has excellent docs and an great team of maintainers allowing you to contribute your own code and ideas to the project.

Admittedly, this post is mostly for testing purposes. Let's see if I'll actually find the time to put real content here.
