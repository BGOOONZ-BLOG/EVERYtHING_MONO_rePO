With solar cell technology continuing to improve, global manufacturing continuing to increase to economies of enormous scale, imagine where that figure is going to be in 10 years time.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The reason why I’m writing this blog post now is that I just watched an excellent video on one of my favorite YouTube channels called `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A\"\n      }}>{`ColdFusion`}</a>{` in which Dagogo excellently outlines recent advances in battery technology and why they are the most viable solution for intermediate power storage of renewable energies. Take a look at the video and I think you’ll have to agree, the solution to global warming is right in front us. It’s as simple as building out our solar cell and battery manufacturing capabilities as quickly as we can.`}</p>\n    <p><div parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\",\n        \"style\": {\n          \"paddingBottom\": \"56.42857142857143%\",\n          \"position\": \"relative\",\n          \"height\": \"0\",\n          \"overflow\": \"hidden\"\n        }\n      }}>{` `}<div parentName=\"div\" {...{\n          \"className\": \"embedVideo-container\"\n        }}>{` `}<iframe parentName=\"div\" {...{\n            \"title\": \"\",\n            \"src\": \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dOn-L6nUS54?rel=0\",\n            \"className\": \"embedVideo-iframe\",\n            \"style\": {\n              \"border\": \"0\",\n              \"position\": \"absolute\",\n              \"top\": \"0\",\n              \"left\": \"0\",\n              \"width\": \"100%\",\n              \"height\": \"100%\"\n            },\n            \"allowFullScreen\": true\n          }}></iframe>{` `}</div>{` `}</div></p>\n\n    <style {...{\n      \"className\": \"grvsc-styles\"\n    }}>{`\n  .grvsc-container {\n    overflow: auto;\n    position: relative;\n    -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    padding-top: var(--grvsc-padding-top, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    padding-bottom: 1rem;\n    padding-bottom: var(--grvsc-padding-bottom, var(--grvsc-padding-v, 1rem));\n    border-radius: 8px;\n    border-radius: var(--grvsc-border-radius, 8px);\n    font-feature-settings: normal;\n    line-height: 1.4;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-code {\n    display: table;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line {\n    display: table-row;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line > * {\n    position: relative;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter-pad {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter {\n    display: table-cell;\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter::before {\n    content: attr(data-content);\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source {\n    display: table-cell;\n    padding-left: 1.5rem;\n    padding-left: var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n    padding-right: 1.5rem;\n    padding-right: var(--grvsc-padding-right, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-source:empty::after {\n    content: ' ';\n    -webkit-user-select: none;\n    -moz-user-select: none;\n    user-select: none;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-gutter + .grvsc-source {\n    padding-left: 0.75rem;\n    padding-left: calc(var(--grvsc-padding-left, var(--grvsc-padding-h, 1.5rem)) / 2);\n  }\n  \n  /* Line transformer styles */\n  \n  .grvsc-has-line-highlighting > .grvsc-code > .grvsc-line::before {\n    content: ' ';\n    position: absolute;\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-add::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-add-background-color, rgba(0, 255, 60, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-diff-del::before {\n    background-color: var(--grvsc-line-diff-del-background-color, rgba(255, 0, 20, 0.2));\n  }\n  \n  .grvsc-line-number {\n    padding: 0 2px;\n    text-align: right;\n    opacity: 0.7;\n  }\n  \n`}</style>\n    <div {...{\n      \"className\": \"footnotes\"\n    }}>\n      <hr parentName=\"div\"></hr>\n      <ol parentName=\"div\">\n        <li parentName=\"ol\" {...{\n          \"id\": \"fn-1\"\n        }}>{`Ever since I first heard of Tesla.
